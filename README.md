## Teacher-Student-priority-queue-in-c

### A. Problem Statement
 If a teacher is being served at the food mess and during the period when he is being served, another teacher comes, then that teacher would get the service (food) next. This process might continue leading to increase in waiting time of students to get food. Ensure in your program that the waiting time of students is minimized.

### B. Build & Execute
Compile the code : gcc priority_queue.c<br>
Once the compilation is done, the a.out file created can be executed.
